 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation to create this Prework Study Guide came from the need to not only practice my craft but also consolidate all that I have learned into one functional and dynamic place. In bringing this project to live I have taken my coding to the next level in HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript as well as debugging more than I care to admit!
